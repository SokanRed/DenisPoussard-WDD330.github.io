// This code creates an event listener that first of all prevents the default behavior of the form, 
//      so it doesn't get submitted when the Add Task button is clicked. 
// Next it creates a task object with a title property that is taken from what was entered in the form. 
// It also has a completed property that has a default value of false. 
// This object is then transformed into a JSON string using the JSON.stringify method 
//      and assigned to the variable data.

// Then we use the fetch() method to send the request and deal with the response. 
// This creates a promise that resolves to a JSON object, 
//      so we use the json() method to create another promise that resolves to a JavaScript object. 
// This object has a single property of id to mimic successfully saving 
//      the task to a database (as this would result in it being assigned an ID by the database).

// We can use this to log a message to the console that refers to the id property that was returned.

// If you open up the 'todo.html' file, add a task in the form and then submit it, 
//      you should see a message in the console similar to the one below.

// << Task saved with an id of 201

// This fakes the fact that the task has been saved to a database and the relevant data has been returned. 
// In reality, the data hasnâ€™t been saved, 
//      and the ID property has just been randomly generated for demonstration purposes.
