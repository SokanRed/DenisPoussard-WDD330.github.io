                            easy to understand and use and focus on the important things first. Mobile is a great forcing function for simlicity.&#10078;

                        <p>First, if you're going to place ads inside your content, make themm simple. They shouldn't take up 40% or plus of your screen real estate. If you really want to do something a little bit different. While the main ad slides out
                            from the bottom of the page, there's a little window in between the content that shows you a full size ad underneath.</p>

                        <p>Programming is about making computers do what you want. A computer program is basically a series of instructions that tell your computer how to perform a task. Unfortunately, though, computers don’t speak the same language as us
                            ― they only use 1s and 0s.</p>

                        <p>The language we’ll be learning in this book is JavaScript, often referred to as the language of the web. JavaScript is a high-level scripting language that is interpreted and compiled at run time. JavaScript is also a dynamic language,
                            so elements of a program can change while it's running, and it can do lots of things in the background at run time.</p>

                        <p>HTML5 is the latest HTML specification, though it’s actually more of an umbrella term for all the latest technologies that are used on the web. This includes HTML, CSS3 and lots of APIs that use JavaScript to interact with web
                            pages.

                        <ol class="subtitle">Node.js</ol>
                        <p>In 2009, Ryan Dahl developed Node.js (commonly known as just Node), which allowed server-side applications to be written in JavaScript. Node is based on Google's V8 engine and allows the creation of fast and powerful real-time
                            web applications written exclusively in JavaScript.</p>
                        <ol class="subtitle">JavaScript In The Console</ol>
                        <p>There are three options available to use a console:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>If you installed Node, you can use the REPL, which stands for Read Eval Print Loop. It allows you to write JavaScript in the console then outputs the results.</li>
                            <li>An option is to use the JavaScript console that comes with your browser. You can access the console by opening your browser and pressing F12.</li>
                            <li>The last option is to use the <a href="https://es6console.com/" target="_blank">E66 Console</a> website.</li>
                        </ul><br>

                        <ol class="subtitle">Text Editors</ol>
                        <p>There are a number of good free options available, including Atom text editor and Brackets (which is actually built using JavaScript!).
                            <br> The community edition of Microsoft Visual Studio is a good option that is also free to use.</p>

                        <ol class="subtitle">Your First JavaScript Program</ol>
                        <p>It will be a single statement that logs the phrase "Hello world!" to the console.</p>
                        <dl class="example">console.log('Hello world!');</dl>

                        <ol class="subtitle">JavaScript in the Browser</ol>
                        <p>JavaScript is an interpreted language and needs a host environment to run. By far the most common use of JavaScript is still to make web pages interactive.</p>

                        <ol class="subtitle">Three Layers of the Web</ol>
                        <p>Nearly all web pages are made up of three key ingredients ― HTML, CSS and JavaScript. HTML is used to mark up the content. CSS is the presentation layer, and JavaScript adds the interactivity.
                            <br>It is widely considered best practice to separate the concerns of each layer, so each layer is only responsible for one thing.

                        <ol class="subtitle">Graceful Degradation and Progressive Enhancement</ol>
                        <p>Whenever you add JavaScript to a web page, you should always think about the approach you want to take. Do you want to start with lots of amazing effects that push the boundaries, then make sure the experience degrades gracefully
                            for those who might not have the latest and greatest browsers? Or do you want to start off building a functional website that works across most browsers, then enhance the experience using JavaScript? The two approaches are
                            similar, but subtly different.

                        <br><a href="indexW01Ex01.html" target="_blank">I Can Click A Rainbow</a><br>
                        <dl class="example">
                            <dt>const btn = document.getElementById('button');</dt>
                            <dt>const rainbow = ['red','orange','yellow','green','blue','rebeccapurple','violet'];</dt>
                            <dt>function change() {</dt>
                            <dd>document.body.style.background = rainbow[Math.floor(7*Math.random())];</dd>
                            <dt>}</dt>
                            <dt>btn.addEventListener('click', change);</dt>
                        </dl>

                        <ol class="subtitle">Don't Break the Web</ol>
                        <p>So new versions of JavaScript can't do anything that isn't already possible in previous versions of the language. All that changes is the notation used to implement a particular feature to make it easier to write. This is known
                            as syntactic sugar, as it allows an existing piece of code to be written in a nicer and more succinct way.
                            <br>The fact that all versions of JavaScript are backwardly compatible means that we can use transpilers to convert code from one version of JavaScript into another. For example, you could write your code using the most up-to-date
                            version of JavaScript and then transpile it into version 5 code, which would work in virtually any browser.
                            <br>The best solution is to transpile your code as part of a build process. (see chapter 15)</p>
